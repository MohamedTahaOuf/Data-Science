# Data science projects:

### In this repo i will share with you some of the task list that i have achived using pyhton and SQL but Firstly I would like to give you the pipline that we should take to get the best output :

1- Understand the data: You should ask a suitable questions to understand the data very well.

2- Data Wrangling: this is the first thing that we should make and that meaning the follow:
> Gather the data : That mean to get the data form the source such as excel,CSV,SQL...etcetera.
> 
> Cleaning Data : That is the next step after we assing the data, For sure allmost the data we have need to be clean such as we have a dublicate or misssng data so we need to clean the data to get the right result, Fortunately we have pandas to fix it.
 
3- Explotry Data Analysis or EDA : That is the final step in data analysis and for the perfect result we should using the visualizion such as plot, histogram ,scatter plot ... etcetera, And here we will take the support from matplotlib & Seaborn or ploty.

4- Convert the data into number: In this step we will transform into machine learning and using the algorithm to predict the values, So we should convert any objeact values into number.

5- Split the data into X (Features) and y (Label).

6- Train test split : This is used to split the data into traing data and this data is seen by the algorithm to train on it, And the test data is not provided to the algorithm to make sure that the algorithm is not only saved the answer.

7- Using the perfect algorithm : In this step we should try many algorithms to get the perfect one, Fortunately we have Sklearn laibrary.

8- Predict and evaluate : Here we figure out if the algorithm we use is need to change some parameters or change it all by using the evalution models for :
> 1- Regression such as mean absoulte error or mean squared error.
> 
> 2- Classifiaction such as accurcy score , AUC , confustion matrix ... etc.

### Now i will share with you some of my work in ML and data analysis:

- [x] [1- Melbourne house regression](https://github.com/MohamedTahaOuf/Data-Science/blob/main/Data/melbourne-house-gridsearchcv-randomforestregressor.ipynb).
