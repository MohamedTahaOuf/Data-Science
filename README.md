# Data science pipline & projects :

### In this repo I will share with you some of the task lists that I have achieved using Python and SQL but Firstly I would like to give you the pipeline that we should take to get the best output :

1- Understand the data: You should ask suitable questions to understand the data very well.

2- Data Wrangling: this is the first thing that we should make and that means the following:
> Gather the data: That means getting the data from a source such as Excel, CSV, SQL...etcetera.
> 
> Cleaning Data: That is the next step after we assess the data, For sure almost the data we have needs to be clean such as if we have a duplicate or missing data so we need to clean the data to get the right result, Fortunately, we have pandas to fix it.
 
3- Explotry Data Analysis or EDA: That is the final step in data analysis and for the perfect result we should use visualization such as plot, histogram, scatter plot ... etcetera, And here we will take the support from Matplotlib & Seaborn or ploty.

4- Convert the data into numbers: In this step, we will transform into machine learning and use the algorithm to predict the values, So we should convert any object values into numbers.

5- Feature selection: In this step, we will use the tools of sklearn to select the appropriate features such as feature importance, correlation..etc.

6- Split the data into X (Features) and y (Label).

7- Train test split: This is used to split the data into training data and this data is seen by the algorithm to train on it, And the test data is not provided to the algorithm to make sure that the algorithm is not only saved the answer.

8- Using the perfect algorithm: In this step, we should try many algorithms to get the perfect one, Fortunately, we have the Sklearn library.

9- Predict and evaluate: Here we figure out if the algorithm we use needs to change some parameters or change it all by using the evaluation models in sklearn for :
> 1- Regression such as mean absolute error or mean squared error ... etc.
> 
> 2- Classification such as accuracy score, AUC, confusion matrix ... etc.

### Now I will share with you some of my work in ML and data analysis:
